## Endogenous Retrovirus (ERV) Extension to Lentivirus-GLUE

<img src="md/lentivirus-glue-erv.jpg" align="right" alt="" width="220" />

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Lentivirus-GLUE-ERV**: an extension to **[Lentivirus-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Lentivirus-GLUE)**.

For many years, it was believed that endogenous retroviruses derived from lentiviruses did not exist. Lentiviral ERVs are indeed much less common than those derived from other retroviral genera, such as *Gammaretrovirus* and *Betaretrovirus*. This scarcity, coupled with the rapid evolution observed in HIV---revealed through genome sequencing technologies that advanced during the response to the HIV pandemic---led to the hypothesis that the Lentivirus genus was a relatively recent emergence, possibly within the last few thousand years. However, this view was fundamentally challenged in 2007 with the identification of rabbit endogenous lentivirus K (RELIK) in the European rabbit genome. The presence of RELIK in multiple leporid species established that lentiviruses have existed for at least 12 million years. Subsequent discoveries of endogenous lentiviruses in other mammals, including lemurs, mustelids, colugos, and springhares, have expanded our understanding of the evolutionary history of lentiviruses, demonstrating their persistence and diversification across millions of years.
