Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retrovirus-derived DNA sequences that occur in the germline genomes of host species. ERVs arise when retroviruses infect germline cells (i.e. spermatozoa, eggs, or early embryonic cells) so that integrated retrovirus DNA is vertically inherited as a novel host allele.

ERVs provide a unique source of retrospective information about the long-term history and retroviruses and their hosts. ERVs derived from lentiviruses are very rare, and for decades they were assumed not to occur. However, as described here, whole genome sequencing of vertebrates in the 2000s led to the discovery of ERVs derived from lentiviruses in a variety of species. These discoveries allowed the timeline of lentivirus evolution to be reliably calibrated.
